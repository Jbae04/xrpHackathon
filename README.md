# xrpNFTnetworkAttempt

This is code for an attempt at using the xrpl library for a project at Cal hacks 2022, It is an attempt at creating a NFT network to build or mint an NFT 
The main issue with this code is an error that says "Your openSSL imprelmentation does not include the RIPEMD160 algorithm, which is required by xrpl"
If you can fix it go ahead !
